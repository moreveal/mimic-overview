# Mimic vs. Chrome: 2026-09-20

Fresh builds on one Windows workstation, using the unchanged frozen workloads. 12/12 correctness gates and 360/360 measured single-page attempts passed. 2 concurrency series stopped or contained a failure. All observations, including failed attempts and excluded warmups, remain in the data. These are controlled fixtures and do not establish general website compatibility.

## Environment

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Platform | Windows-11-10.0.26200-SP0 |
| CPU | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-14700KF |
| RAM | 31.83 GiB |
| Chrome | 152.0.7977.82 (headless=new) |
| Mimic / Chrome V8 | 15.2.124.1-rusty / 15.2.124.21 |
| Started / completed | 2026-09-20T20:24:00.878033+04:00 / 2026-09-20T20:38:31.811856+04:00 |

Executable hashes are checked before every launch. This is an interactive workstation with background applications and antivirus enabled; cache and scheduler variation remain possible.

## Startup and ready memory

Ten fresh processes per runtime, alternating order, after an excluded warmup. Both answer the same Target.getTargets readiness probe. Summed process-tree RSS includes the initial page and can count shared pages more than once; it is not marginal Page memory.

| Runtime | CDP ready p50, ms | p95, ms | Ready RSS, MiB | Ready private bytes, MiB |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mimic | 212.62 | 232.79 | 45.04 | 96.03 |
| Chrome | 244.72 | 257.41 | 373.89 | 180.52 |

## Warm execution and completion

Twenty retained samples per workload/runtime. Each iteration creates a new Page and origin in the warm process. Execution includes invoking the workload and detecting its validated result. Completion also includes navigation; Page creation and teardown are excluded. Lower is better.

| Workload | Mimic execution, ms | Chrome execution, ms | Mimic completion, ms | Chrome completion, ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Static DOM | 3.23 | 4.09 | 33.69 | 23.04 |
| JavaScript / crypto | 38.17 | 28.77 | 68.65 | 47.84 |
| DOM mutations | 274.29 | 30.59 | 304.49 | 49.56 |
| Async / networking | 67.34 | 26.59 | 99.98 | 45.41 |
| React | 48.27 | 22.28 | 85.43 | 42.40 |
| WebAssembly | 3.84 | 5.48 | 34.31 | 24.85 |

## Cold end-to-end completion

Ten fresh-process samples per workload/runtime. Includes process startup, Page creation, navigation, execution, teardown and process exit. OS caches are not flushed. Server maintenance and temporary-profile removal are excluded. A failed series is withheld from comparisons.

| Workload | Mimic p50, ms | Chrome p50, ms |
|---|---|---|
| Static DOM | 574.49 | 455.73 |
| JavaScript / crypto | 616.30 | 515.56 |
| DOM mutations | 865.30 | 507.63 |
| Async / networking | 641.49 | 490.31 |
| React | 626.17 | 512.42 |
| WebAssembly | 575.86 | 430.32 |

## CPU and memory during warm work

Process-tree user plus kernel time per session; sampled peaks may miss short-lived allocations.

| Workload | Runtime | CPU, ms/session | Peak RSS, MiB | Peak private bytes, MiB |

## Concurrent Pages

Fresh process per level, one excluded warmup, then max(5, ceil(20/N)) measured waves. Throughput includes setup and teardown but excludes the separate 250 ms recovery wait. Every attempted level is shown. A stopped series is not a stable successful result.

Recovery uses no forced collection. Allocator pools and shared runtime artifacts can remain resident; this table alone cannot prove leak absence. Private memory, marginal slopes, CPU and latency distributions are included in the numerical data.

## Measurement boundaries

Identical local fixtures, unique origins, HTTP cache disabled, full supported resource loading. The six fixtures cover static DOM, JavaScript/crypto, 3,000 DOM elements, asynchronous networking and Workers, React 18.3.1 and WebAssembly. Completion requires the exact expected result. No paint or network-idle delay is included. External high-resolution clocks, 5 ms result polling and 50 ms memory sampling are unchanged. Slow samples are retained; p95 from 10–20 samples is unstable. These measurements do not establish feature parity or costs on arbitrary sites.

## Data and provenance

[Numerical export](public-results.json) includes all summary metrics, numerical single-page and startup samples, concurrency outcomes and executable/harness hashes. [Full report](report.md) and [raw observations](raw.json) retain detailed evidence. [Optimization decisions](../../../docs/performance/optimization-campaign-20260914.md) distinguish these Windows observations from the primary paired Linux experiments.
