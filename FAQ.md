# Frequently asked questions

## What is Mimic?

A browser execution runtime for workflows that need JavaScript and browser state
without rendered pixels. It occupies the space between raw HTTP clients and full browsers.

## Is it headless Chrome?

Mimic uses V8 for JavaScript execution, but does not embed or launch Chromium.
It implements the browser behavior needed by its supported workflows.

## Can I use my existing automation tools?

Mimic exposes a subset of the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Selected workflows have
been exercised with Puppeteer, Pyppeteer, and Playwright tooling. Support depends
on the commands and behavior your workflow uses; it is not a universal drop-in
replacement. Start with the [verified runnable examples](examples/README.md).

## What can I get out of a page?

Evaluated JavaScript values, DOM content, and static DOM snapshots with available
assets. A DOM snapshot is not a screenshot or a complete offline copy of an application.

## Does it render pages?

Mimic does not produce page pixels or require a GPU. Screenshots, rendered PDFs,
video playback, full CSS layout, and Canvas/WebGL pixel rendering are outside the
current scope. Use a full browser when the visual output is the result you need.

## Does every website work?

Compatibility is still evolving. JavaScript execution alone does not establish
browser compatibility: supported APIs, loading behavior, and interactions all
matter. The local benchmark fixtures cover a limited set of behaviors and are
not a website compatibility score.

## Is it faster or smaller than Chrome?

Mimic is actively being developed toward direct HTTP lightness with browser
compatibility. The current measurements already show a memory advantage in
supported workloads. Latency still has substantial work ahead: slower cases
are optimization targets, not the performance level we're aiming to stop at.

See the [dated benchmark results](BENCHMARKS.md). Startup, task completion,
concurrency, CPU, and memory measure different things. Some workloads can favor
Chrome. We do not claim a universal speedup or infer production operating costs
from synthetic fixtures.

## Which platforms are supported?

The public beta ships Windows amd64 and Linux amd64 builds. Linux requires
glibc 2.39+, libgcc_s, and installed fonts; validation used Ubuntu 24.04 under
WSL2. ARM64 and musl/Alpine are not packaged. Both hosts currently expose the
Chrome 152 Windows environment profile. Native speech synthesis is unavailable
on Linux. Performance charts are the retained Windows checkpoint, not Linux results.

## Is it open source? Where can I download it?

Implementation sources remain private. Ready-to-run binaries are available in
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/moreveal/mimic/releases/tag/v0.1.5). This repository contains the product overview,
benchmarks, and MIT-licensed client examples. Mimic itself uses
[PolyForm Shield 1.0.0](LICENSE.md), which permits commercial use subject to its
noncompete provisions and other terms; it is not an open-source license.

## Can I use it to run untrusted code?

Mimic is not a security sandbox. Its CDP endpoint is intended for trusted local
clients, and independent pages are not a security boundary for hostile tenants.

## Does it guarantee access to a website?

Recorded development sessions have reached the success page on a Cloudflare
challenge laboratory, received a BrowserScan Normal verdict, and captured Amazon
storefront content. These are encouraging compatibility checkpoints, not a
measured success rate across anti-bot products. The cause of admission is not
isolated by those observations.

Site policies, authentication, rate limits, and server decisions still apply.
Compatibility with browser behavior does not guarantee acceptance by any service.
