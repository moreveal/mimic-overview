## Let the website do the work

**The website's JavaScript. Browser state. A lighter runtime.**

Mimic is a browser execution runtime built around V8, with its own browser
environment and no rendering engine. Run website logic, work with the DOM,
and automate through familiar CDP tools without embedding Chromium.

**Our ambition: direct HTTP lightness with browser compatibility.**

**Public Beta · Windows & Linux.** [Download v0.1.3 →](https://github.com/moreveal/mimic-overview/releases/tag/v0.1.3) · [Run the examples →](examples/README.md)

Actively developed. Feedback and workflow help: **`moreveal`** on Discord.

## Use it with Playwright

Start Mimic on `127.0.0.1:9222`, then connect with the standard Playwright API:

```javascript
import { chromium } from "playwright-core";

const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP("http://127.0.0.1:9222");

const context = browser.contexts()[0];
const page = context.pages()[0];

await page.goto("https://www.google.com");

await page.getByRole("link", { name: "Sign in" }).click();
```

**This is the Playwright client connected over CDP. Chromium is not installed,
launched, or embedded by Mimic.** The beta archive contains the runtime and
[runnable Playwright and Puppeteer examples](examples/README.md); no browser
download or GPU is required.

## Working browser behavior

The current automation regression covers navigation, locators, form input,
fetch/XHR, frames, Shadow DOM, popups, redirects, cookies, history, multi-page
state, and network observation: **38/38 checks across two project regression
suites**. These are Mimic's own compatibility checks, not the official
Playwright test suite.

Broader development checkpoints exercise execution and observable browser behavior:

| Capability | Verified checkpoint |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React ✓** | 200 cards, effects, fetch, and state transitions. |
| **WebAssembly ✓** | Module instantiation and 100,000 integer-add calls. |
| **Workers ✓** | Messaging and worker fetch in supported workflows. |
| **DOM mutations ✓** | 3,000 elements with validated final structure and text. |
| **Networking ✓** | Fetch and XHR in deterministic local fixtures. |
| **Playwright / Puppeteer ✓** | Stock client libraries over CDP: navigation, locators, forms, fetch, frames, Shadow DOM, popups, redirects, cookies, history, multi-page state, and network events. |
| **100 concurrent pages ✓** | Completed Linux static, CPU, and React comparison with Chrome. |

These are scoped, verified workflows; compatibility continues to expand.

## Measured, not assumed

Fresh-build Windows checkpoint from **September 14, 2026**, against **Chrome 152.0.7977.82** in headless mode, on Windows 11 x64 (Intel i7-14700KF, 31.83 GiB RAM).

| Controlled checkpoint | Mimic | Chrome 152 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| CDP-ready process-tree RSS | **28.84 MiB** | 376.26 MiB |
| 50 static pages: active RSS | **1,568.62 MiB** | 4,079.95 MiB |
| 50 static pages: throughput | **69.64 sessions/s** | 21.00 sessions/s |

**92% lower ready RSS. 62% less active RAM and 3.32× throughput at 50 static
pages.** These are controlled local fixtures on this machine, not arbitrary
websites. Ready RSS includes the initial page and is not per-page memory.

Mimic is actively evolving toward direct HTTP lightness with browser compatibility.
These are selected strengths from an early checkpoint; see Known limitations and
the complete benchmark report for the current tradeoffs.

## Real-world compatibility checkpoints

Complex compatibility checkpoints have also included client-side challenge flows,
browser diagnostics, and production storefront content. They help test how the
runtime handles demanding combinations of browser behavior.

| Development checkpoint | Observed result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cloudflare challenge laboratory** · September 12 | Mimic moved from the challenge response to the explicit success page on ScrapingCourse. The transition also succeeded in a subsequent paired check. |
| **BrowserScan** · September 12 | The tested session received the explicit **Normal** verdict. |
| **Amazon storefront** · September 11 | Storefront navigation and campaign cards were captured with available assets; the exported snapshot was checked offline in Chrome. |

These are specific recorded site/session outcomes, not a measured pass rate across
anti-bot systems or proof of why a service admitted a session. Amazon's checkpoint
covers storefront content, not login or checkout. Compatibility continues to evolve;
site policies and server decisions still apply.

## Configure once. Then automate.

Designed to simplify automation: set the environment up front, start Mimic, and
connect your CDP client. No Chromium installation is required.

After receiving a beta build, save this as `profile.json`:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "baseProfile": "chrome-152-windows-x64-headful-controlled-v1",
  "hardware": { "logicalProcessors": 8, "deviceMemoryGB": 8 },
  "locale": {
    "languages": ["en-US", "en"],
    "timezone": "America/New_York",
    "intlLocale": "en-US"
  },
  "preferences": { "colorScheme": "dark" }
}
```

```powershell
.\mimic.exe --profile profile.json --chrome 152 --browser-mode headful --listen 127.0.0.1:9222
```

`headful` selects an environment profile; Mimic still renders no pixels. Profiles
configure supported language, timezone, hardware, and preference observations.
Use separate profiles per context and native proxies when your workflow needs them.

examples. Implementation sources and internal research remain private.

## Known limitations

Warm execution is faster in two of six fixtures and still trails Chrome most sharply
for DOM mutations. The Windows host stopped Mimic's 100-page levels at its memory-pressure
guard. On Linux, allocator arenas are reclaimed after Page teardown, but active memory per
concurrent Page remains higher than Chrome because each Page owns an independent V8 isolate.

Mimic is in active development. The beta supports **Windows amd64** and
**Linux amd64 with glibc 2.39+** (validated on Ubuntu 24.04 under WSL2). The
browser environment remains **Chrome 152 on Windows** on either host. ARM64 and
musl are not packaged. Linux needs installed fonts and has no native speech synthesis.
The benchmark charts are Windows measurements; the separate 100-Page density results are Linux measurements.

It implements a subset of browser APIs and CDP. It does not render screenshots,
PDFs, Canvas/WebGL output, or video, and does not provide full CSS layout or complete
Chrome compatibility. Supported automation workflows do not imply that every
Playwright or Puppeteer feature works. See the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for the practical boundaries.
